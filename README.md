# BailFacile Frontend Challenge

## ‚ùì Why this challenge

This coding challenge is designed to assess the skills of candidates in frontend application development. It is language/framework agnostic, but some instructions are specific for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), since it is the technology we use.

## üèÅ Challenge

Develop a React application that displays a list of applicants to rent an appartment in a **sortable table**. Each applicant has details like a firstname, a lastname, a job title, a monthly salary, a guarantor (optional) and a preferred move in date.

Mock data is available in the `applicants.json` file.

When clicking on an applicant in the table (each row should be clickable), **details are displayed on the right side in a drawer component**. Inside this component we can **add a rating to the application with a star system from 1 to 5**. Ratings should be saved in state.
